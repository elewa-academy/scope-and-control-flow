# Block Scope

Code blocks adds a whole new level of behavior to JS variables. Take a look through the examples step-throughs below to learn the basics of Block Scope and how to diagram it in your sketches.

_A little warning_ -  These sketches only capture the behavior of __var__ & __let__ within code blocks:
* Just opening and closing braces
* loops
* conditionals
* try/catch blocks

These diagrams __*do not*__ apply to functions or function execution.

When searching online to learn more about Block Scope, you will also come across info about __lexical scope__ and __closures__.  Those topics are outside the scope of this repo and will be covered in the next chapter.
